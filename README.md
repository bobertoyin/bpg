# `bpg`

`bpg` is a command line tool for adding white borders to your images (like a hipster)

## does `bpg` even mean anything?

bpg - border-producing gizmo

bonus points if you're in on my friends' inside joke and know what it really stands for

## why `bpg` over `imagemagick` or any random app on the app store?

* fun little side-project
* tool that focuses on one thing in my photography workflow
* didn't know about `imagemagick`
* tired of using random app/website
